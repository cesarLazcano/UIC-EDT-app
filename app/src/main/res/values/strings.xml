        "About Us
        In September 2000, the Engineering Design Team (EDT) was created by a group of UIC undergraduate engineering students whose interests were grounded in technology and robotics. The club was designed to give students a chance to use their engineering knowledge to design and build robots in order to achieve a set of goals while competing against other teams.

Since robotics incorporates a wide variety of engineering disciplines, including mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering, the club soon became very diverse, with numerous young men and women with a variety of engineering and non-engineering backgrounds joining the ranks. When students join EDT, they can expect to become part of an active and capable team that holds a strong passion for what they do. The overall experience and knowledge that they gain not only nurtures their passion to excel as UIC students, but also helps them develop professional engineering attitudes.

Mission Statement
Our mission at the Chicago Engineering Design Team is to enhance and provide practical applications for all aspects of engineering including computer, electrical, and mechanical engineering through the engagement of creative design projects. Our designs are award winning, and it is our mission to continue crafting quality machines that help advance the respecting disciplines.

What We Do
Gain valuable experience as engineers
Develop leadership and communication skills
Expand studentsâ€™ knowledge of numerous engineering disciplines
Reinforce the strong reputation of the UIC College of Engineering
Work on many varying multi-disciplinary projects
Promote STEM to the community and our peers"</string>
